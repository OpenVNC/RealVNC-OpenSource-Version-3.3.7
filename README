VNC 3.3.7 Source Distribution for Unix platforms

This software is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence as published
by the Free Software Foundation.  See the file LICENCE.TXT for the conditions
under which this software is made available.  VNC also contains code from other
sources.  See the Acknowledgements section below, and the individual files for
details of the conditions under which they are made available.


There are five programs here:

	vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for X.

	vncserver - this is a wrapper script which makes starting an X VNC
		    server (i.e. desktop) more convenient.  It is written in
		    Perl, so to use the script you need that.

	vncpasswd - this program allows you to change the password used to
		    access your X VNC desktops.  The vncserver script uses
		    this program when you first start a VNC server.

	vncconnect - this program tells a running instance of Xvnc to connect
		     to a listening VNC viewer (normally the connection is made
		     the other way round i.e. the viewer connects to Xvnc).

	Xvnc - this is the X VNC server - it is both an X server and a VNC
	       server.  You normally use the vncserver script to start Xvnc.


To build this distribution you need a C++ compiler as well as a C compiler.
You also need a reasonably recent version of the X window system installed.
This come as standard with most unix machines.  If you don't have it installed,
see http://www.x.org or http://www.xfree86.org

To build everything but Xvnc, do:

  % ./configure
  % make

This should build first some libraries - zlib, rdr and rfb - then vncconnect,
vncpasswd and vncviewer.  If you already have zlib installed on your system you
can run "./configure --with-installed-zlib" if you prefer (this is strongly
advised on FreeBSD, since we've been told there are problems otherwise).

Xvnc differs from the other programs in that it is built inside a cut-down
version of the X build tree.  This is based around the XFree86 3.3.2 "server
only" distribution, which in turn is based on the X11R6.3 distribution from
the X consortium.  To build Xvnc, do:

	% cd Xvnc
	% make World

If you have trouble building Xvnc, see the Xvnc/README file for more details.

If it all builds OK you should copy the programs to some directory which
is in your PATH environment variable, such as /usr/local/bin.  You can use
the vncinstall script to do this for you:

	% cd ..
	% ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin

This will also attempt to install the manual pages in an appropriate directory.
You can specify an alternative directory as a second argument to vncinstall:

	% ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man

If you want to use the Java VNC viewer, you should copy the class files from
the classes directory to some suitable installation directory such as
/usr/local/vnc/classes:

	% mkdir -p /usr/local/vnc/classes
	% cp classes/* /usr/local/vnc/classes

We recommend that you use the vncserver script to run Xvnc for you.  You can
edit the script as appropriate for your site.  Things you may need to change
include:

 * The location of Perl - if Perl is not installed in /usr/bin you'll need
   to edit the "#!/usr/bin/perl" first line of vncserver.

 * $vncClasses - this specifies the location of the Java classes for
   the VNC viewer applet.  The default is /usr/local/vnc/classes.

 * Xvnc's font path and color database.  If you have an installation of
   X which is not in the standard place you may need to add arguments to the
   Xvnc command line to set these.  These should be appended to the $cmd
   variable at the comment "# Add font path and color database...".
